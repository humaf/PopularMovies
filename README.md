# Popular Movies
This is the second app for Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree.I built this application from scratch,some of the things I 

used for this app are 

* Recycler Views.

* Content Providers. 

* Picasso.

* Movie DB API.

## Getting Started
This app uses the Movie DB API.You need to have an API key in order to run the app.You can create your own API key at 

https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup?language=en-EN .

Once you get the API key you need to set it in the buil.gradle(app) file.

## Challenges

Some of the Challenges I faced during this project was working with Recycler Views , Adapters and content providers.

I had to dig in a lot into documentaion and sample examples to understand and make it working.
